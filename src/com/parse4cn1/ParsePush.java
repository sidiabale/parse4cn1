/**
 * The ParsePush is a local representation of data that can be sent as a push notification.
 * <p>
 * The typical workflow for sending a push notification from the client is to construct a new ParsePush, 
 * use the setter functions to fill it with data, and then use ParsePush.send() to send it.
 * <p>
 * <b>Notes:</b>
 * <br> 
 * 1. In order to use send push notifications, Client Push should be enabled in the
 * Parse App settings. Bear in mind, however, that it is recommended not to enable 
 * client push in production apps.
 * <br>
 * 2. Unlike the corresponding
 * <a href="https://parse.com/docs/android/api/com/parse/ParsePush.html">ParsePush</a> 
 * class from the Parse Android SDK, methods for channel subscription and 
 * unsubscription are available in this library via the 
 * {@link ParseInstallation} where they arguably more naturally belong.
